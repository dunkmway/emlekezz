## Notes

Do I want to be able to edit notes? I'm thinking not since I just want to stream my thoughts.
I can instruct the ai chat that it should prefer newer information when there is conflicting info

I should probably save my content as I am typing so that I don't lose any data, something like a 10 second debounce

Chunking should happen by logical groupings starting with the highest and working down the hiearchy.
For example first check H1 and if an H1 section is too large check its H2s, etc. I will need a
definitive hiearchy

A remind feature where certain notes will be to remind me of something, maybe on a certain day
I give the chat bot the current datetime
